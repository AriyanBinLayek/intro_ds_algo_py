# intro_ds_algo_py
This repo contains programs from my upcoming book (to be published at the end of the year) - Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms in Python. The language of the book is Bangla (aka Bengali), but someday I may also start writing in English (for that I need to learn to write in English).
This is a very introductory book which will prepare the readers to learn more about data structures and algorithms.
